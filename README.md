# diabetes-detection

Hey, if you want to run it for some reason, you should have:
1) python3.10
2) pip

Then install dependencies:
```shell
pip install jupyterlab
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then launch jupyterlab
```shell
jupyter lab
```

Go to http://localhost:8888/ (in case you didn't change the default host-port)

1) At first, you are supposed to run EDA
2) Then you can go through the training notebook

cheers!
